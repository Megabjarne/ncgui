# NCGUI
ncgui is a gui library built on top of the ncurses library.
It is based around containers and elements to structure the gui, and is easily extendable.

## Usage
Simply clone or download the repository, open a shell in the directory and run `make demo` to compile and run the demo program. Run `make lib` to compile a static library (ncgui.a), and include this like it was another object file when compiling your code, see makefile for example of how this is done for the demo program.

## Documentation
This project still lacks detailed documentation, see demo program for a practical example, otherwise read the source or wait for documentation to be completed.
