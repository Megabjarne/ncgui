# NCGUI
ncgui is a gui library built on top of the ncurses library.
It is based around containers and elements to structure the gui, and is easily extendable.

## Usage
Simply clone or download the repository, open a shell in the directory and run `make install` to install the library. To compile and run the demo program, run `make demo`. <br/>

After installing the library, include the needed headers, and compile the program with the flag `-l ncgui`. See the makefile for a practical example of this.

## Documentation
This project still lacks detailed documentation, see demo program for a practical example, otherwise read the source or wait for documentation to be completed.
